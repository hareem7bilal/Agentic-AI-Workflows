    "# Graded Lab : Tool Use and Reflective Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore how AI agents can enhance research workflows by leveraging external tools and engaging in critical self-reflection. You'll learn how to build and integrate callable tools—such as web and academic search functions, and connect them to a language model using OpenAI's tool-calling API. Then, you’ll guide the agent to not only generate content but also **reflect** on its own output, improving the quality and depth of the final report. By the end of this lab, you will have implemented a mini agent capable of searching, reasoning, and publishing structured reports in HTML—laying the foundation for more advanced multi-step and autonomous AI systems."

The sum of matrices is determined by the sum in F-algebra, and the product of matrices is determined by the product of mappings. The system of equations, whose matrix is a matrix of mappings, is called a system of additive equations. I considered the methods of solving system of additive equations. As an example, I consider the solution of a system of linear equations over the complex field provided that the equations contain unknown quantities and their conjugates.\\n  Linear mappings of algebra over a commutative ring preserve the operation of addition in algebra and the product of elements of the algebra by elements of the ring.

      "✅ Final answer:\n",
      "Recurrent novae are binary star systems that undergo periodic outbursts, with radio observations providing crucial insights into the mechanisms driving these events. Below is a summary of several notable studies focusing on radio observations of recurrent novae:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **T Pyxidis (T Pyx)**:\n",
      "   - **Study**: The 2011 outburst of T Pyx, considered one of the most unusual recurrent novae, was analyzed through radio observations.\n",
      "   - **Findings**: The radio emission during this event was broadly consistent with thermal emission originating from the nova's ejecta. This supports the interpretation that the radio characteristics can be attributed to the ejected material from the nova explosion [Ness et al., \"The 2011 Outburst of Recurrent Nova T Pyx: Radio Observations,\" 2014](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...785...78N).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **RS Ophiuchi**:\n",
      "   - **Study (2023)**: RS Ophiuchi was observed during its 2021 outburst using the MeerKAT and LOFAR radio telescopes, focusing on low-frequency emissions.\n",
      "   - **Findings**: These observations offered new insights into the radio characteristics of the nova, revealing essential details about the event's low-frequency behavior and its relation to the material ejected during the explosion [de Ruiter et al., \"Low-frequency radio observations of recurrent nova RS Ophiuchi with MeerKAT and LOFAR,\" 2023](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/publications/low-frequency-radio-observations-of-recurrent-nova-rs-ophiuchi-wi/).\n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Historical Study**: An earlier study marked the first radio detection of an outburst from RS Ophiuchi. This breakthrough demonstrated that the nova's radio emissions were predominantly non-thermal and had significantly higher brightness temperatures compared to classical novae, indicating different emission mechanisms at play [Bode & P., \"RS Ophiuchi — First Radio Detection of a Recurrent Nova Outburst,\" 1982](https://www.nature.com/articles/315306a0).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Light Curve Dynamics**:\n",
      "   - **Study**: The evolution of radio light curves in novae typically reveals an initial rise characterized by the optically thick ejecta, with a positive spectral index. This phase transitions as the ejecta expand and the optical depth decreases, providing a clearer view of the underlying outburst dynamics [Research on radio light curves in novae](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/523/1/132/7159730).\n",
      "\n",
      "These studies underscore the importance of radio observations in understanding the physics of recurrent novae, particularly in addressing the nature of ejecta and emission mechanisms during nova outbursts.\n",

    "**Goal:** Implement `reflection_and_rewrite(report)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, your goal is to develop a function that takes a report, analyzes it, generates a structured reflection, and produces an improved version of the report. This involves two main tasks: crafting a precise prompt and setting up a correctly configured response call to the language model.\n",

    "## Key Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Create a User Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objective**: Guide the language model to output a structured response in JSON format.\n",
    "- **Format**: Ensure the output includes two keys, `\"reflection\"` and `\"revised_report\"`.\n",
    "- **Details**: Your reflection should cover strengths, limitations, suggestions, and opportunities. The revised report should incorporate these elements to improve clarity and academic tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Configure the Response Call\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**: Use the specified model (e.g., `\"gpt-4o-mini\"`) and set the temperature equal to the `temperature` parameter of the graded function.\n",
    "- **Structure**: Make sure the response setup directs the model properly, ensuring the JSON format is adhered to without additional commentary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing these steps, your function will effectively transform and improve the given reports. Handle JSON parsing carefully to ensure the output is valid and reliable. Happy coding!"

      "✅ Final answer:\n",
      "The topic of radio observations of recurrent novae is an area of active research, and several recent studies have shed light on this phenomenon. Below is a summary of relevant findings from some key studies:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Research Highlights\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Radio Observations of Nova V1723 Aql**\n",
      "   - A study by Jennifer H. S. Weston et al. [2013] focuses on the radio light curves of novae which evolve over months to years, providing insights into the dynamics of the nova shell. The research draws on data from enhancements in technology such as the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to offer new perspectives on ejecta mass, which is often larger than expected from theoretical models. In particular, observations of the classical nova V1723 Aql revealed unexpected features such as a rapid increase in radio flux and peculiar bumps in the light curve, indicative of shocks in the outflow. This work has offered a richer understanding of the density profile and mass loss dynamics in such explosions [arXiv:1306.2265](http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2265v2), [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.2265v2).\n",
      "\n",

      "1. **Radio Observations of Nova V1723 Aql**\n",
      "   - A study by Jennifer H. S. Weston et al. [2013] focuses on the radio light curves of novae which evolve over months to years, providing insights into the dynamics of the nova shell. The research draws on data from enhancements in technology such as the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to offer new perspectives on ejecta mass, which is often larger than expected from theoretical models. In particular, observations of the classical nova V1723 Aql revealed unexpected features such as a rapid increase in radio flux and peculiar bumps in the light curve, indicative of shocks in the outflow. This work has offered a richer understanding of the density profile and mass loss dynamics in such explosions [arXiv:1306.2265](http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2265v2), [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.2265v2).\n",
