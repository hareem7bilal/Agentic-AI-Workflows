      "   - **Authors**: Paul A. O'Gorman\n",
      "   - **Summary**: This academic paper examines how precipitation extremes are expected to intensify due to climate change. The study integrates theory, modeling, and observational data to explore the physical factors controlling this response. While extreme precipitation is anticipated to grow, especially in tropical regions, the sensitivity to warming remains complex, particularly where convection plays a significant role. Challenges remain in understanding mesoscale convective organization and tropical precipitation sensitivity.\n",

As a consequence, more resources like land and water are needed, which complicates achieving global food security. Intensified droughts, heat waves, and floods result in water scarcity and decreased crop yields, raising the risk of concurrent crop failures in multiple regions.\n",

      " Here is a summary of two seminal papers found on arXiv, along with pertinent context from Wikipedia. The first paper, \"Back to the seminal Deutsch algorithm\" by Giuseppe Castagnoli (2017), explores the foundational elements of Deutsch’s quantum algorithm, emphasizing its potential to open interdisciplinary research avenues in quantum computing. This algorithm is crucial in modeling computational problems that involve quantum bits, showcasing the early and impactful steps in the quantum computing field. The second paper, \"Discovering seminal works with marker papers\" by Robin Haunschild and Werner Marx (2019), discusses a bibliometric methodology for identifying key research papers within a scientific community using a novel approach called marker papers, analyzed with reference publication year spectroscopy (RPYS). Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) as an example, the paper highlights innovative strategies for scholarly literature discovery and evaluation. Nigel Anstey’s Wikipedia entry, while not directly focused on seminal papers, underscores the significant impact individual contributions can have on entire fields, akin to the influence of groundbreaking papers in academia. Anstey's work, particularly in seismic exploration, has laid the groundwork for modern techniques in oil and gas exploration, stressing the importance of foundational research and innovation.\n",
